# Creative Optimisation Report
I finished this mini-project during my weeks work experience at Jellyfish, and they generously allowed me to publish it.

**raw_data.csv** contains raw data for several performance metrics of an app (conversion rates, etc.)  
**opt_dates.csv** contains dates when creative & metadata changes went live 

The jupyter notebook produces a report that compares mean and median conversion rates 2 weeks prior to the optimisation to those 2 weeks after.
